# database-filler
Description:
This is the database filler project that feeds the scheduler project with information or schedules.

We tried to make the operation of filling database automated as possible as we can and 
we can say its automated with 95%

the other 5% cover all the cases that can't be covered with the filler by hard coding them

so reviewing the database before using it will be always important to cover these cases

problems should work on:
1. lecture extension can't know in which half of period should be placed so we place it in whole period

2. sometimes schedules come with some errors that we can't know its case even as humans so it from hard coded 5%
